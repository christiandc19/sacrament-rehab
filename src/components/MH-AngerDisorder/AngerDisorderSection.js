                <h1>INTERMITTENT EXPLOSIVE DISORDER</h1><br/>
                <p>Most common in people under 35, Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), is a chronic mental health disorder characterized by impulsive, violent, and aggressive behavior, often culminating in verbal and physical outbursts of rage. A few of the most common examples of IED ‘attacks’ or ‘spells’ can include:
                <br/><br/><ul>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Road rage </li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Verbal outburst</li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Domestic abuse</li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Throwing/breaking objects</li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Physical violence </li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Fits of rage</li><br/>
                <li><FaRegStar className='star'/> Self-injury</li><br/>
                </ul>
                The most significant factor which can determine Intermittent Explosive Disorder is that the reaction exceeds the circumstances, and should be disproportionate to the appropriate amount of anger. <br/><br/>
                The behavior pattern can be not only detrimental to your life and goals but also to the safety of those around you. Relationships can be strained and school or work performance is affected as well.
